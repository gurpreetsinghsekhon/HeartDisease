# Heart Disease Classification

This project implements a heart disease classification model using machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict whether a person is at risk for heart disease. The model uses health metrics such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more.

## Libraries Used

### Data Science Tools:
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: Numerical operations and array handling.

### Data Visualization:
- **matplotlib**: For creating visualizations (plots and graphs).
- **seaborn**: For advanced data visualizations.

### Machine Learning Tools:
- **scikit-learn**:
  - **StandardScaler**: Feature scaling to standardize the data.
  - **train_test_split**: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - **confusion_matrix**: Evaluates the classification model's performance.

### Deep Learning Tools:
- **Keras**:
  - **Sequential**: A simple neural network architecture.
  - **Dense**: Fully connected layer used in the neural network.

## Dataset
This project uses the **Heart Disease UCI dataset**, containing various attributes such as:
- Age, sex, cholesterol, blood pressure, and other medical information.
- The target variable is whether or not the person has heart disease (1 = presence, 0 = absence).



## Results
Models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

## Conclusion
This project predicts heart disease to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and intervention.
